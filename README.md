Ultimate Repo of bookmarklets

# Credits
As a professional script-kiddie I am not capable of making these scripts, only basic maintaining. As such, I give Credit to @rxzyx for most of these scripts, and the rest are unknown developers, although I send kudos to them.  

# Installation

Installation may seem scary, but no. Simply click Control+Shift+O to open bookmark manager, click on the three dot button on the top and click import and with the file you should have downloaded, select that. From there, you'll get a new bookmark folder named Import with Bookmarks Bar inside of them, ignore them and do whatever you want with the Bookmarklets folder.
